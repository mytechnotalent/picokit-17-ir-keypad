## Overview

The seventeenth Picokit lesson. The NEC infrared remote acts as a numeric
keypad: each decoded digit is appended to an accumulator, the running value
is shown on the red, yellow, and green lamps and on the 1602 I2C LCD, and
every five seconds the node transmits an authenticated heartbeat over LoRa
to a Python gateway that logs and displays it.

<br>

## What it teaches

- Mapping the NEC command codes for the remote number keys to decimal
  digits.
- Accumulating a bounded keypad value and clearing it with a dedicated key.
- Rendering the accumulated value to the 1602 I2C LCD and the status LEDs.
- Sealing a tiny JSON body with Argon2id and XChaCha20-Poly1305 and sending it
  with an AT+SEND over the RYLR998.

<br>

## Hardware

| Peripheral | Pico 2 pin | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| VS1838B IR | GP5 | numeric keypad input |
| 1602 I2C LCD | GP2 SDA / GP3 SCL | keypad value display |
| Red / Yellow / Green | GP16 / GP18 / GP17 | accumulated value indicator |
| Onboard LED | GP25 | heartbeat, one blink per transmit |
| RYLR998 | GP8 TX / GP9 RX | LoRa heartbeat |
| Debug Probe | SWCLK/SWDIO/GND, GP0/GP1 | SWD and the console |

<br>

## How it works

The node runs `monitor_step` in a loop. Every 200 ms it polls the VS1838B
infrared receiver and maps each decoded NEC command to a decimal digit,
accumulating up to four digits in the keypad value. It shows the value on
the status LEDs and the 1602 LCD, and every 5 seconds it seals
`{"n":17,"s":<seq>,"p":<pin>}` with the field key and sends it over LoRa.
The gateway authenticates each frame and only then parses it.

<br>

## Build and flash

```bash
cd firmware
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DPICO_BOARD=pico2 -DPICO_PLATFORM=rp2350-arm-s
cmake --build build
openocd -f interface/cmsis-dap.cfg -f target/rp2350.cfg \
  -c "program build/picokit_17_ir_keypad.elf verify reset exit"
```

<br>

## Watch the node

Open the console at 115200 and reset:

```text
BOOT
=== PICOKIT-17 IR KEYPAD // KEYPAD + AUTHENTICATED HEARTBEAT ===
PIN 1 DIG 1
PIN 12 DIG 2
PIN 1234 DIG 4
RX from 0x0001, N bytes
```

<br>

## The gateway

```bash
cd gateway
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 listen.py --port /dev/cu.usbserial-A50285BI --hub 0001 --network 18 --db gateway.db
```

It prints `OK node=17 rssi=...` per authenticated heartbeat. The terminal
dashboard `python3 tui.py --db gateway.db` and the web dashboard
`python3 web/app.py --db gateway.db` show the same rows.
