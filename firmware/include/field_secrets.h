/**
 * @brief LAB-ONLY shared AES-128 field key, the ASCII bytes
 * "picokit-lab-key!".
 *
 * WARNING: This value is committed for the classroom lab so the firmware
 * and the instructor gateway share one session key. Production firmware
 * MUST provision the key from one-time-programmable (OTP) memory at
 * manufacture and MUST NEVER embed a key in flash. Shipping this file
 * as-is is a lab convenience, not a secure deployment.
